# CryptoPals Python Solutions

Python solutions for the original set of six [CryptoPals challenges](https://cryptopals.com/).

These solutions were written as a teaching tool and are optimized for realism. The adversary is assumed to have as
little information as possible, and the schemes and protocols are implemented as close to their documented specification
as possible.

As a teaching tool, these solutions are also optimized for reading comprehension rather than performance, re-usability,
or anything else you might expect from production code. So if you feel stuck on a challenge, please open an issue!
